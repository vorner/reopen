// Forbid unsafe code in the actual code, but tests use libc::kill.
#![cfg_attr(not(test), forbid(unsafe_code))]

//!  A tiny `Read`/`Write` wrapper that can reopen the underlying IO object.
//!
//! The main motivation is integration of logging with logrotate. Usually, when
//! logrotate wants to rotate log files, it moves the current log file to a new
//! place and creates a new empty file. However, for the new messages to appear in
//! the new file, a running program needs to close and reopen the file. This is
//! most often signalled by `SIGHUP`.
//!
//! # Traits
//!
//! The amount of supported traits is somewhat limited. For example, [BufRead][std::io::BufRead] or
//! [Seek][std::io::Seek] are not implemented, because the behavior across reopens would be
//! confusing if not outright wrong.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The `signals` feature adds support to registering a reopening as a result of received a signal
//! (for example the `SIGHUP` one).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! This allows reopening the IO object used inside the logging drain at runtime.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};
//! use std::io::Error;
//!
//! use log::info;
//! use reopen::Reopen;
//!
//! fn open() -> Result<File, Error> {
//!     OpenOptions::new()
//!         .create(true)
//!         .write(true)
//!         .append(true)
//!         .open("/log/file")
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     let file = Reopen::new(Box::new(&open))?;
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "signals", not(windows)))]
//!     file.handle().register_signal(signal_hook::SIGHUP)?;
//!     simple_logging::log_to(file, log::LevelFilter::Debug);
//!     info!("Hey, it's logging");
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that this solution is a bit hacky and probably solves only the most common use case.
//!
//! If you find another use case for it, I'd like to hear about it.

/// A `Read`/`Write` proxy that can reopen the underlying object.
///
/// It is constructed with a function that can open a new instance of the object. If it is signaled
/// to reopen it (though [`handle`](#method.handle)), it drops the old instance and uses the
/// function to create a new one at the next IO operation.
///
/// # Error handling
///
/// The reopening is performed lazily, on the first operation done to the object. Opening a new
/// instance can fail with an error. If this happens, the error is returned as part of the
/// operation being performed ‒ therefore, you can get an error like `File not found` while
/// performing `read`.
///
/// If an error happens, the operation is aborted. Next time an operation is performed, another
/// attempt to open the object is made (which in turn can fail again).
///
/// # Scheduling of a reopen
///
/// The implementation tries to ensure whole operations happen on the same FD. For example, even if
/// multiple [`read`][Read::read] calls need to be performed as part of
/// [`read_exact`][Read::read_exact], the [`Reopen`] will check for reopening flags only once
/// before the whole operation and then will keep the same FD.
///
/// If this is not enough, the [`Reopen`] can be [locked][Reopen::lock] to bundle multiple
/// operations without reopening.
///
/// # Handling of ends
///
/// Certain operations make ordinary file descriptors „finished“ ‒ for example,
/// [`read_to_end`][Read::read_to_end]. Usually, further calls to any read operations would produce
/// EOF from then on.
///
/// While this reaches the end of the currently opened FD and further read operations would still
/// produce EOF, reopening the FD may lead to it being readable again. Therefore, reaching EOF is
/// not necessarily final for [`Reopen`].

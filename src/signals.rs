    /// * Under the hood, this uses the [`signal-hook`](https://crates.io/signal-hook) crate, so
    ///   the same signal can be shared with other actions (to eg. also reload a configuration).
    /// * The same restrictions, errors and panics as in the case of
    ///   [`signal_hook::register`](https://docs.rs/signal-hook/*/signal_hook/fn.register.html)
    ///   apply.
    /// * This installs a signal handler. Signal handlers are program-global entities, so you may
    ///   be careful.
    /// * If there are multiple handles for the same signal, they share their signal handler ‒ only
    ///   the first one for each signal registers one.
    /// * Upon signal registration, the original handler is stored and called in chain from our own
    ///   signal handler.
    /// * A single handle can be used for multiple signals.
    /// * To unregister a handle from a signal handle, use the returned `SigId` and the
    ///   [`signal_hook::unregister`](https://docs.rs/signal-hook/*/signal_hook/fn.unregister.html).

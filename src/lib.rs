//!  A tiny `Read`/`Write` wrapper that can reopen the underlying IO object.
//!
//! The main motivation is integration of logging with logrotate. Usually, when
//! logrotate wants to rotate log files, it moves the current log file to a new
//! place and creates a new empty file. However, for the new messages to appear in
//! the new file, a running program needs to close and reopen the file. This is
//! most often signalled by SIGHUP.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! This allows reopening the IO object used inside the logging drain at runtime.
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate libc;
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate log;
//! extern crate reopen;
//! extern crate simple_logging;
//!
//! use std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};
//! use std::io::Error;
//!
//! use reopen::Reopen;
//!
//! fn open() -> Result<File, Error> {
//!     OpenOptions::new()
//!         .create(true)
//!         .write(true)
//!         .append(true)
//!         .open("/dev/null")
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let file = Reopen::new(Box::new(&open));
//!     // Must be called before any threads are started
//!     unsafe { file.handle().register_signal(libc::SIGHUP).unwrap() };
//!     simple_logging::log_to(file, log::LevelFilter::Debug);
//!     info!("Hey, it's logging");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that this solution is a bit hacky and probably solves only the most common use case.
//!
//! If you find another use case for it, I'd like to hear about it.
